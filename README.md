# MyFatoorah Payment Gateway for Craft Commerce

**A [Top Shelf Craft](https://topshelfcraft.com) creation**


* * *


## TL;DR.

This gateway enables transactions through the MyFatoorah [Embedded Payment](https://docs.myfatoorah.com/docs/embedded-payment) API. 


## Installation

1. From your project directory, use Composer to require the plugin package:

   ```
   composer require topshelfcraft/commerce-myfatoorah
   ```
   
    _Note: The MyFatoorah gateway plugin is also available for installation via the Craft CMS Plugin Store._

2. In the Control Panel, go to **Settings → Plugins** and click the **“Install”** button for MyFatoorah.

3. There is no Step 3.


## Configuration

To customize the plugin's behavior, you can add a `myfatoorah.php` file to your Craft config directory:

```php
<?php

return [
    '' => [
        //
    ];
];
```


## What are the system requirements?

Craft 4.4+ and PHP 8.0.2+


## I found a bug.

Please open a GitHub Issue or submit a PR to the `4.x.dev` branch.
